## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

# Collaboration

## Logistical

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**

- We are available during class and lab times, and until 6pm on Saturdays.

**What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

- Primarily through Slack

**How often will you take breaks?**

- 10 minute break every hour of work.

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

- Timebox ourselves to come up with a solidified plan to progress. If all else fails, reach out to our teacher/TA for an assist, and respect the 15 minute rule.

## Cooperative

**Make a list of each person’s strengths.**

- Andra: Communicative, likes to read documentation, awareness of dev concepts/jargon.

- Manuch: Algorithmic thinking, concise and communicative.

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?**

- Teamwork makes the dream work.

**In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?**

- Andra: Algorithmic thinking

- Manuch: Iteration of concepts/craft

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?**

- Start the work day with a stand-up to identify blockers, code review, goals, and tasks that need to be completed.

## Conflict Resolution

**What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?**

- Discuss feelings/lay things out on the table and discuss how to better the group. If we aren't able to sort it out ourselves, ask our teacher to help mediate.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?**

- Discuss feelings/lay things out on the table and discuss how to better the group. If we aren't able to sort it out ourselves, ask our teacher to help mediate.

**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

- Patience and empathy. Meeting each other where we're at.
